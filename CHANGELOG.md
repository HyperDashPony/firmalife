### Changes

- Reintroduced hydroponic planters. They must be connected to sprinkler systems from the bottom.
- Fixed polished and chiseled sealed bricks not being valid cellar blocks.
- Fixed an issue where copper and oxidized copper pipes still were able to connect
- Fixed a tooltip missing a translation key for planters.
- Fixed maize curing always giving a single maize no matter the input count
- Updated the cellar and greenhouse finding system to allow players to set a 'expected' type of multiblock for the climate station to find. This means that if you right click with a certain greenhouse block on the climate station, the station will attempt to find a greenhouse of that type without it having to touch one of those blocks itself. This should in theory allow for more freedom in placing the climate station.
